Sc2CustomOverlays is a dynamic overlay displayer, designed to be fully customizable for streaming or broadcasting Starcraft 2.

See the wiki for more information about what can and cannot be done so far.

Future plans
* Button variable control that can make choices visual instead of textual (colors/images on top of the button).
* The ability to have a client-server model for live broadcasting during tournaments--allowing someone off camera to update any variables.
* Timer-based rotating variables--have a variable rotate through values on a given interval.
* Things other people suggest that I haven't thought of.
